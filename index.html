        <h2>Representative Works</h2>

          <div class="work-block">
            <p style="text-indent:2em;"><strong>《红楼雨》</strong> (Crimson Pavilion in Rain) is an original electronic piece in the Guofeng Melodic Dubstep style, composed and arranged by R.Fia (Ren Feifei). The track combines oriental aesthetics with a modern rhythmic sensibility. As one of the few female electronic music producers in this field, her work stands out and was successfully selected for the annual compilation VOL.5 of the renowned domestic electronic music label CEM Records, making it the only representative piece by a female producer in the compilation. The track also received a featured recommendation on the NetEase Cloud Music homepage, sparking widespread discussion and acclaim on the platform.</p>
<p>Written in classical Chinese and based on the traditional six-tone scale, the song features instruments like xiao, guzheng, and bianzhong. It tells a tragic love story set in ancient Jiangnan, where a woman and her warrior husband are ultimately parted by war and fate.</p>
<p>The arrangement evolves with the narrative—starting with the woman's poetic longing and shifting to the battlefield from the man's perspective. Through expressive vocals, vivid storytelling, and cinematic production, "The Crimson Pavilion in Rain" delivers an immersive listening experience that feels like a musical film.</p>

            <p style="text-indent:2em;"><strong>《What's your fantasy》</strong> is a modern synthpop track written, composed, arranged, and performed by R.Fia.
</p> <p>Born from a low point in her life, the song reflects on the quiet power of fantasy—the little dreams we carry with us, even in our darkest moments. Some are distant, some within reach: watching stars by the sea, holding someone close, chasing a sky of your own.</p> 
<p>Born from a low point in her life, the song reflects on the quiet power of fantasy—the little dreams we carry with us, even in our darkest moments. Some are distant, some within reach: watching stars by the sea, holding someone close, chasing a sky of your own.</p>

<p>These fragments of longing become light in the fog, reminding us that even when life feels uncertain, there’s always something worth moving toward.</p>

            <p style="text-indent:2em;"><strong>《Can I Be With You》</strong> is a cross-border collaboration between R.Fia and a Korean musician. As lyricist and composer, R.Fia explores the quiet ache of restrained love—when feelings run deep but remain unspoken.</p>
<p>The song captures the emotional tension between longing and hesitation, where tenderness coexists with distance. Like a calm ocean hiding an inner storm, it speaks to the beauty and heartbreak of holding back, of loving without asking for more.</p>

        <p style="text-indent:2em;">During the recurring pandemic in the spring of 2022, Tencent Music Entertainment Group launched a large-scale public welfare online concert project.——<strong>《春天不打烊音乐会》</strong>，The aim was to convey warmth and hope to the public through music and boost morale in the fight against the pandemic. The concert brought together numerous talented musicians with diverse styles and featured public welfare performances via online livestreams, providing ongoing companionship and spiritual solace to audiences staying at home.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:2em;">As a highly regarded independent electronic musician，<strong>R.Fia Feifei Ren </strong> was invited to participate in this charity concert, representing the unique voice of contemporary female electronic creators on the public welfare stage. During the livestream, I performed some of my signature works, delivering a highly immersive and healing performance with vivid electronic arrangements and an ethereal voice. My music seamlessly blends Oriental aesthetics with cyberpunk elements, making it one of the highlights of the evening.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:2em;">This livestream was broadcast through <strong>QQ Music, 全民K歌, and Kugou Music</strong> and other platforms simultaneously，<strong>with a total audience of over 10,000 viewers.</strong>，The live chat and comment sections were buzzing with interactions, with many viewers commenting, "Listening to her music feels like traveling to a futuristic Orient" and "This is the first time I've been moved by electronic Chinese-style music."</p>

        <p style="text-indent:2em;">R.Fia Ren Feifei was invited to participate in the annual special project "If We Wrote 2021 as a Song" launched by China Media Group. This project aimed to reflect on the societal changes and the emotions of the times in China over the year through the form of music, bringing together several representative musicians to collectively compose a musical memory of the year for the people.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:2em;">In this project, R.Fia performed her original song 《旗》 — a piece that not only showcased her signature ethereal and delicate vocal style but also conveyed a profound expression of unity, faith, and the spirit of the times through its lyrics and melody. The song, with its grand yet warm arrangement, evoked a deep resonance among listeners, reflecting the intertwining experiences of the pandemic, perseverance, and hope.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:2em;">As a representative of the new generation of independent musicians, R.Fia's participation not only added a distinctive electronic touch to the entire project but also reflected her cross-genre integration and her music creation philosophy, which balances artistic expression and social responsibility.</p>
