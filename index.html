            <p style="text-indent:2em;"><strong>《红楼雨》</strong> (Crimson Pavilion in Rain)  It's a piece I composed and produced, blending traditional Chinese instruments like the pipa and xiao with modern electronic music. The lyrics are written in classical Chinese, and the story takes place in ancient times— during a war, a husband goes off to battle, while his wife waits for him at home. But in the end, they’re forever separated by fate. Through this song, I wanted to express the beauty and sadness of love, distance, and longing. It’s also my way of bringing Chinese poetry and emotion into a </p>

            <p style="text-indent:2em;"><strong>《What's your fantasy》</strong> I wrote it during a low point in my life, when I felt lost and stuck. But even then, I realized—we all have a little fantasy inside us. Some are big, some are small.
Some feel close, some feel far away. Some might seem impossible, but some are right in front of us. Maybe it’s watching the stars by the sea, or holding someone you love.
Maybe it’s chasing your own sky, or just going home to be with family. When we feel down or alone, these little fantasies give us the strength to keep going. Because no matter how tough life gets, there’s always something beautiful to hold on to.</p>

            <p style="text-indent:2em;"><strong>《Can I Be With You》</strong> Can I Be With You is a cross-border collaboration between me and a Korean musician. I wrote the lyrics and composed the melody. The song explores the quiet ache of restrained love — the kind where emotions run deep, yet are never fully expressed. It’s about two people who feel something powerful, but choose to hold back. Because sometimes, we’re told that mature love means self-control, or even letting go. Like the ocean, calm on the surface but turbulent underneath, this song captures the inner storm of unspoken feelings — the longing to be together, the fear of getting hurt, and the heartbreak of turning away while still in love. It’s a song about tenderness, distance, and the kind of love that leaves behind a gentle, lasting sorrow.</p>

        <p style="text-indent:2em;">During the recurring pandemic in the spring of 2022, Tencent Music Entertainment Group launched a large-scale public welfare online concert project.——<strong>《春天不打烊音乐会》</strong>，The aim was to convey warmth and hope to the public through music and boost morale in the fight against the pandemic. The concert brought together numerous talented musicians with diverse styles and featured public welfare performances via online livestreams, providing ongoing companionship and spiritual solace to audiences staying at home.</p>

During the livestream, I performed some of my signature works, delivering a highly immersive and healing performance with vivid electronic arrangements and an ethereal voice. My music seamlessly blends Oriental aesthetics with cyberpunk elements, making it one of the highlights of the evening.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:2em;">This livestream was broadcast through <strong>QQ Music, 全民K歌, and Kugou Music</strong> and other platforms simultaneously，<strong>with a total audience of over 10,000 viewers.</strong>，The live chat and comment sections were buzzing with interactions, with many viewers commenting, "Listening to her music feels like traveling to a futuristic Orient" and "This is the first time I've been moved by electronic Chinese-style music."</p>

        <p style="text-indent:2em;">R.Fia Ren Feifei was invited to participate in the annual special project "If We Wrote 2021 as a Song" launched by China Media Group.

        <p style="text-indent:2em;">In this project, R.Fia performed her original song 《旗》 — a piece that not only showcased her signature ethereal and delicate vocal style but also conveyed a profound expression of unity, faith, and the spirit of the times through its lyrics and melody. The song, with its grand yet warm arrangement, evoked a deep resonance among listeners, reflecting the intertwining experiences of the pandemic, perseverance, and hope.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:2em;">As a representative of the new generation of independent musicians, R.Fia's participation not only added a distinctive electronic touch to the entire project but also reflected her cross-genre integration and her music creation philosophy, which balances artistic expression and social responsibility.</p>
